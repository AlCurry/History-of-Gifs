# History-of-Gifs
GWU bootcamp homework - use the gif api to access and display data with js / jquery
Using a theme of dance styles, for fun, initially buttons are displayed with the various styles. Buttons can be pressed to display 10 gifs for that style, initially still images.  Clicking the image will set the gif in motion, clicking again will stop it. New buttons can be added for any word or gif theme. 

The title Gif-A-Zoid is a play on a Midnight Star favorite "Freak-A-Zoid" circa 1983.
